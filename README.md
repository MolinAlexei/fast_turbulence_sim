# fast_turbulence_sim
Fast simulator of turbulent field observations in galaxy clusters with X-IFU - Gaussian Random Field projected in binned maps with emission weighted projection and convolution by PSF. It relies on both JAX and haiku libraries. It was used in the following paper:

[Toward mapping turbulence in the intra-cluster medium III. Constraints on the turbulent power spectrum with Athena/X-IFU](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/06/aa48937-23/aa48937-23.html)
